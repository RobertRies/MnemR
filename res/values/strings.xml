Often times computers store things for humans and remind them at time.
MnemR is about the other way around: helping people remember things themselves in the human memory.
Continious repetition with visual and auditive anchors (mnemonics) aid the process by making things more sticky in long-term memory.
MnemR (pron. - Nehmer -) is a mnemonic content learning tool for the android platform designed to enable all kinds of human memory trainer applications..
